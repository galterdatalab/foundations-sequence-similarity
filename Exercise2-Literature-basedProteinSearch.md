Here, we are going to try using a published manuscript on a mutation in the entry spike protein for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We'll find a protein sequence that matches the publication and BLAST it against viral proteins.  


The manuscript we will be using is:  
Korber B, Fischer WM, Gnanakaran S, Yoon H, Theiler J, Abfalterer W, Hengartner N, Giorgi EE, Bhattacharya T, Foley B, Hastie KM, Parker MD, Partridge DG, Evans CM, Freeman TM, de Silva TI; Sheffield COVID-19 Genomics Group; McDanal C, Perez LG, Tang H, Moon-Walker A, Whelan SP, LaBranche CC, Saphire EO, Montefiori DC. [Tracking Changes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike: Evidence that D614G Increases Infectivity of the COVID-19 Virus](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7332439/). Cell. 2020 Aug 20;182(4):812-827.e19. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2020.06.043. Epub 2020 Jul 3. PMID: 32697968; PMCID: PMC7332439.  

If this does not work because of BLAST server lag, we'll try a [shorter, simpler protein record](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/YP_401672.1).  

# Protein BLAST
Protein BLAST works basically the same as nucleotide BLAST, but with different algorithm choices and different databases specific to proteins.
